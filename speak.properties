4=Useful commands:\n\n   The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions\nfor rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses\nprinting of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE'\ncommand restores long descriptions.\n   The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea\nof what the game is about.\n   The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish\nto continue playing.\n   The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.\n   The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.\n   The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.\n   The 'LOOK' command prints a description of your surroundings.\n   The 'SCORE' command prints your current score and ranking.\n   The 'TIME' command tells you how long you have been playing.\n   The 'DIAGNOSE' command reports on your injuries, if any.\n\nCommand abbreviations:\n\n   The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.\n   The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.\n   The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.\n\nContainment:\n\n   Some objects can contain other objects.  Many such containers can\nbe opened and closed.  The rest are always open.   They may or may\nnot be transparent.  For you to access (e.g., take) an object\nwhich is in a container, the container must be open.  For you\nto see such an object, the container must be either open or\ntransparent.  Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes;\nthe number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their\nsizes.  You may put any object you have access to (it need not be\nin your hands) into any other object.  At some point, the program\nwill attempt to pick it up if you don't already have it, which\nprocess may fail if you're carrying too much.  Although containers\ncan contain other containers, the program doesn't access more than\none level down.\n\nFighting:\n\n   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when\nattacked.  In some cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.\nUseful verbs here are 'ATTACK <villain> WITH <weapon>', 'KILL',\netc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be useful.  You have a\nfighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a fight,\ngetting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.\nStrength is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to\nfight someone immediately after being killed.  Other details\nshould become apparent after a few melees or deaths.\n\nCommand parser:\n\n   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.\nFor reasons of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their\nfirst six letters.  All others are ignored.  For example, typing\n'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is not only meaningless, it also\ncreates excess effort for your fingers.  Note that this trunca-\ntion may produce ambiguities in the intepretation of longer words.\n\n   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands\nthe following types of things--\n\n   Actions:\n	Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.\n	Fairly general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP,\n	PUT DOWN, etc.\n\n   Directions:\n	NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.\n	Other more obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in\n	only certain situations.\n\n   Objects:\n	Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.\n\n   Adjectives:\n	Some adjectives are understood and required when there are\n	two objects which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g.,\n	DOORs, BUTTONs).\n\n   Prepositions:\n	It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but\n	the parser attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous\n	without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON\n	CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably won't do anything interesting.\n	When a preposition is used, it should be appropriate;  'GIVE CAR\n	WITH DEMON' won't parse.\n\n   Sentences:\n	The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc-\n	tions.  In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas)\n	can be placed on the same line.\n\n   Ambiguity:\n	The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of\n	actions which require objects that are not explicitly specified.\n	If there is only one possible object, the parser will assume\n	that it should be used.  Otherwise, the parser will ask.\n	Most questions asked by the parser can be answered.
5=Welcome to Dungeon!\n\n   You are near a large dungeon, which is reputed to contain vast\nquantities of treasure.   Naturally, you wish to acquire some of it.\nIn order to do so, you must of course remove it from the dungeon.  To\nreceive full credit for it, you must deposit it safely in the trophy\ncase in the living room of the house.\n\n   In addition to valuables, the dungeon contains various objects\nwhich may or may not be useful in your attempt to get rich.  You may\nneed sources of light, since dungeons are often dark, and weapons,\nsince dungeons often have unfriendly things wandering about.  Reading\nmaterial is scattered around the dungeon as well;  some of it\nis rumored to be useful.\n\n   To determine how successful you have been, a score is kept.\nWhen you find a valuable object and pick it up, you receive a\ncertain number of points, which depends on the difficulty of finding\nthe object.  You receive extra points for transporting the treasure\nsafely to the living room and placing it in the trophy case.  In\naddition, some particularly interesting rooms have a value associated\nwith visiting them.  The only penalty is for getting yourself killed,\nwhich you may do only twice.\n\n   Of special note is a thief (always carrying a large bag) who\nlikes to wander around in the dungeon (he has never been seen by the\nlight of day).  He likes to take things.  Since he steals for pleasure\nrather than profit and is somewhat sadistic, he only takes things which\nyou have seen.  Although he prefers valuables, sometimes in his haste\nhe may take something which is worthless.  From time to time, he examines\nhis take and discards objects which he doesn't like.  He may occas-\nionally stop in a room you are visiting, but more often he just wanders\nthrough and rips you off (he is a skilled pickpocket).
6=Please answer the question.
7=You clearly are a suicidal maniac.  We don't allow psychotics in the\ndungeon, since they may harm other adventurers.  Your remains will be\ninstalled in the land of the living dead, where your fellow adventurers\nmay gloat over them.
8=What?  You don't trust me?  Why, only last week I patched a running\nRSX system and it survived for over thirty seconds.  Oh, well.
9=Now let me see...\nWell, we weren't quite able to restore your state.  You can't have\neverything.
10=Do you wish me to try to patch you?

44=		BOOOOOOOOOM
45=You are in large room which seems to be air conditioned.  In one\ncorner there is a machine (?) which is shaped somewhat like a clothes\ndryer.  On the 'panel' there is a switch which is labelled in an\nobscure dialect of Swahili.  Fortunately, I know this dialect, and the\nlabel translates to 'START'.  The switch does not appear to be manip-\nulable by any human hand (unless the fingers are about 1/16 by 1/4\ninch).  On the front of the machine is a large lid, which is #.
46=closed
47=The cave is very windy at the moment, and your candles have blown out.
48=You are in a small room that has only one door, to the east.
49=In the corner of the room on the ceiling is a large vampire bat who\nis obviously deranged and holding his nose.

59=You are outside a large gateway, on which is inscribed:\n\n	"Abandon every hope, all ye who enter here."\n\nThe gate is open.  Through it you can see a desolation, with a pile of\nmangled corpses in one corner.  Thousands of voices, lamenting some\nhideous fate, can be heard.
60=The way through the gate is barred by evil spirits, who jeer at your\nattempts to pass.

In\nthe east corner are stacked the remains of dozens of previous\nadventurers who were less fortunate than yourself.  To the east\nis an ornate passage, apparently recently constructed.
65=Amid the desolation, you spot what appears to be your head,\ntastefully impaled on the end of a long pole.
66=You are standing on the top of flood control dam #3, which was\nquite a tourist attraction in times far distant.  There are paths\nto the north, south, east, and down.
67=The sluice gates on the dam are closed.  Behind the dam, there can\nbe seen a wide lake.  A small stream is formed by the runoff from\nthe lake.

98=A solid rainbow spans the falls.
99=According to Prof. TAA of MIT Tech, the rapidly changing magnetic\nfields in the room are so intense as to fry all the delicate innards\nof the robot.  I really don't know, but in any event, smoke is coming\nout of its ears, and it has stopped moving.

111=The force of the explosion has caused the ledge to collapse belatedly.
112=The ledge collapses, leaving you with no place to land.

114=The way is blocked by debris from an explosion.
115=You may recall your recent explosion.  Well, probably as a result of\nthat, you hear an ominous rumbling, as if one of the rooms in the\ndungeon has collapsed.

119=Suddenly a sinister, wraithlike figure, cloaked and hooded, appears\nseeming to float in the air before you.  In a low, almost inaudible\nvoice he says, "I welcome you to the ranks of the chosen of Zork.  You\nhave persisted through many trials and tests and have overcome them\nall.  One such as yourself is fit to join even the implementers!"\nHe then raises his oaken staff and, chuckling, drifts away like a\nwisp of smoke, his laughter fading in the distance.

147=You are stopped by a cloud of poisonous gas.
148=Time passes... and you die from some obscure poisoning.
149=The gnome glances at his watch.  "Oops!  I'm late for an\nan appointment."  He disappears, leaving you alone on the shelf.

162=A ghost appears in the room and is appalled by your desecration\nof the remains of a fellow adventurer.  He casts a curse on\nall of your valuables and orders them banished to the land of\nthe living dead.  The ghost leaves, muttering obscenities.
163=There is a rumble from deep within the earth, and the room shakes.

259=The gnome appears increasingly nervous.

Long have I\nwaited for one capable of releasing me from my burden!"  He taps you\nlightly on the head with his staff and mumbles a few well-chosen spells.\nYou feel yourself changing, growing older and more stooped.  For a\nmoment there are two identical mages staring at each other among the\ntreasures, then you watch as your counterpart dissolves into a mist\nand disappears, a sardonic grin on his face.
727=Suddenly, as you wait in the dark, you begin to feel somewhat\ndisoriented.  The feeling passes, but something seems different.\nAs you regain your composure, the cloaked figure appears before you\nand says, "You are now ready to face the ultimate challenge of\nZork.  Should you wish to do this somewhat more quickly in the\nfuture, you will be given a magic phrase which will at any time\ntransport you by magic to this point.  To select the phrase, say\n	INCANT, <word>\nand you will be told your own magic phrase to use by saying\n	INCANT, <phrase>\nGood luck, and choose wisely!"
